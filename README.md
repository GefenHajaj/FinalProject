These are all the files needed to run an app called "BCademy".
This app was developed to help teens all over the world to study better and get higher grades.

In order to run it, you need to have Django and Flutter installed.

The BackEnd folder holds all the files needed to run the server.

The third folder has some files that document the developing process, including screenshots.
